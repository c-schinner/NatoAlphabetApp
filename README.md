# NATO Phonetic Alphabet App
The NATO Phonetic Alphabet App is a simple Python application that allows users to convert words into their corresponding NATO phonetic alphabet codes. 

The NATO phonetic alphabet is used to spell out letters and words clearly and accurately, especially in situations where communication might be distorted or misunderstood.

This application uses a CSV file containing the mapping between letters and their corresponding NATO phonetic codes. 

The app prompts the user to input a word and then generates the NATO phonetic alphabet representation for that word.

# Features
Converts words into NATO phonetic alphabet codes for clearer communication.

Utilizes a CSV file (nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv) to map letters to codes.

Handles user input and provides appropriate error handling.

# Installation
Save the main.py file to your computer

Download the nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv file and ensure it's in the same directory as the main.py file.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script and the CSV file.

Run the following command to execute the app:

python main.py

# Usage
When the app is executed, it will prompt you to enter a word.

Type the desired word and press Enter.

The app will then display the NATO phonetic alphabet representation of the entered word.

If the input contains characters that are not valid letters, the app will display an error message and prompt you to enter a valid word again.

You can exit the app by closing the terminal or command prompt.

# Example

    Please type a word: python

    'Papa' 'Yankee' 'Tango' 'Hotel' 'Oscar' 'November'

# Note
This app uses the NATO phonetic alphabet mapping provided in the nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv file. 

Ensure that the CSV file is correctly formatted and contains the necessary data for accurate conversion.
